        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          I started the Computer Science program with the goal of transitioning into software engineering. While I had some background in technology and 
          application development, I wanted to develop a much deeper and broader skill set that would prepare me for real-world software engineering roles. 
          Throughout my studies, I've built a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, web development, mobile development, and database 
          management. My passion for technology has grown even more as I've had the opportunity to design, build, and enhance multiple types of applications using 
          both mobile and full-stack web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the program, I developed and published Android applications using Java and Android Studio, which allowed me to gain experience in mobile development, 
          user interface design, and backend integration. As I continued learning, I expanded into full-stack web development, where I worked with both the MEAN 
          (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stacks. This helped me develop skills in RESTful API development, 
          asynchronous data handling, secure authentication, and dynamic front-end user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my capstone project, I chose to take a console-based Java application I originally developed — a Rescue Animal Management System — and transform it into 
          a fully functional full-stack web application. This project allowed me to apply everything I've learned throughout the program, while also challenging me to 
          learn new technologies such as Spring Boot, JWT-based authentication, and advanced MongoDB query optimization. My final application combines Angular for the 
          front-end, Spring Boot for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database, providing a modern, scalable, and secure system that reflects professional software development 
          practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I applied key software engineering principles such as modular design, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and secure coding. 
          I also focused heavily on data structures and algorithms while implementing features like filtering, sorting, and pagination to ensure efficient performance 
          as the dataset grows. I worked extensively with MongoDB to design a flexible schema that can handle dynamic data, and built full CRUD functionality to manage 
          rescue animal records, users, and authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the technical skills, this program has helped me grow tremendously in my ability to communicate professionally, document my work, and organize 
          complex projects. I've learned how to break large problems into smaller, manageable tasks, and how to clearly communicate my work both through written 
          documentation and code reviews. During assignments and project discussions, I learned the value of clear communication. Writing documentation, managing code 
          with version control (Git/GitHub), participating in peer feedback, and presenting technical work have all helped me develop soft skills that are essential in any 
          software engineering role. These professional skills are equally important as technical abilities, and I feel confident in my ability to contribute 
          to software development teams, collaborate with peers, and engage with clients or stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of my studies, I've also developed a strong security mindset. I now approach application development with an understanding of potential 
          vulnerabilities and the importance of securing user data through proper authentication, authorization, and data handling practices. Implementing secure 
          JWT-based authentication in my capstone project was one example where I applied this mindset directly to a real-world system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this program, I've built a solid foundation in both hard and soft skills that I will carry forward in my professional career. My experience with 
          multiple development stacks, mobile and web applications, secure coding, database design, and system architecture has prepared me to step confidently into 
          a software engineering role. I am excited to continue learning, improving, and contributing to meaningful software projects in the future.

      <!-- CODE REVIEW SECTION -->
      <section id="code-review" class="section">
        <h2>Code Review</h2>
  
        <p>
          A code review is a systematic process in which developers examine each other's code to identify bugs,
          improve code quality, and ensure that the codebase meets industry standards. It promotes collaboration,
          encourages learning, and helps catch issues early before they become costly problems in production.
          Code reviews are an essential part of professional software development workflows, used in both open-source
          and enterprise teams.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The benefits of a code review include improved readability, better maintainability, consistency in coding style,
          and increased overall reliability of software. It also serves as an opportunity for knowledge sharing and mentoring,
          making teams more resilient and aligned in their practices.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In the video below, I walk through the original version of my Rescue Animal Management System, a Java-based console program.
          I then explain the structured enhancements I implemented as part of my CS 499 Capstone Project. These enhancements showcase 
          my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and full-stack web development using Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.
          I highlight specific code improvements, architectural decisions, and technical challenges I solved during the transformation
          of the system into a web application.

      <!-- SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SECTION -->

      <section id="category1" class="section">
        <h2>Category 1: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
  
        <p>
          The artifact I selected for enhancement is my Rescue Animal Management System, originally developed as a Java-based console 
          application for the IT-145 course. The program allowed users to intake, reserve, and list rescue dogs and monkeys, storing animal 
          data in memory using ArrayList. While it worked for a console environment, it was very limited. It had no real database,
          no user interface, and no way to use the application outside of development environments.
        </p>

        <img src="images/original-java-console.png" alt="Original Java console application" class="original-screenshot">

        <p>
          For this course, I chose to significantly enhance this artifact by transforming it into a full-stack web application using Spring Boot (Java)
          for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Angular for the frontend. The result is a fully interactive and responsive application where 
          users can view, filter, and manage rescue animals through a modern web interface.
          
        <div class="animal-list-image-stack">
          <img src="images/angular-animal-list.png" alt="Angular frontend animal list view" class="animal-list-screenshot">
          <img src="images/angular-animal-list2.png" alt="Mobile Angular frontend animal list view" class="mobile-animal-list-screenshot">
        </div>
          
          Admin users can log in to manage animals by adding new ones, updating their details, or removing them from the lists.
          This new version can be used from any device with a browser and stores all data in a real database instead of memory.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases both my growth and current capabilities in software design, full-stack development,
          RESTful APIs, and database management. The project brings together everything I've learned about frontend design, backend development, database storage,
          and application security. I built a secure backend with Spring Boot that exposes REST API endpoints. 
        </p>
          
          <div class="springboot-image-stack">
              <img src="images/springboot-controller1.png" alt="Spring Boot controller code1" >
              <img src="images/springboot-controller2.png" alt="Spring Boot controller code2" >
          </div>

        <p>
          I connected that to an Angular frontend where users  can interact with the data. I also added a login system that uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and encrypted
          passwords with BCrypt so only admins can make changes to the animal list.

          <img src="images/new-app-login.png" alt="New App Login" class="login-screenshot">
          
          I changed the code so that dogs and monkeys are now handled through one flexible Animal class,
          which makes the project easier to expand if we want to add more animals in the future.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The artifact directly supports the course outcome related to software engineering, software design, and databases. It shows that I can build an organized, 
          layered backend, interact with a database, and create a frontend that communicates securely with the backend. I followed the enhancement plan I submitted earlier 
          in the course and have completed the upgrades as planned, so there are no changes needed to my plan. I also made progress on outcomes relating to secure 
          development practices.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Working on this project taught me a lot about how real applications are built. I learned how to connect the frontend and backend through API calls 
          and how to send and verify JWT tokens to protect certain features. I learned how to handle CORS issues, how to upload and display images using Angular 
          and Spring Boot, and how to make the user interface more compact and organized. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. One of the biggest challenges 
          I faced was getting the authentication system to work properly and making sure that only admins could perform certain actions. I also had trouble at first 
          getting images to upload and display correctly from the database but eventually solved the problem by improving how the data was stored and retrieved. As
           I made progress, I also spent time cleaning up the frontend layout to reduce spacing and improve the look and feel of the animal cards.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          This enhancement turned a basic, text-based Java program into a complete, real-world application that could actually be used by a rescue organization.
          It demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, software design, and secure coding. More importantly, it shows my ability to take something simple 
          and build it into something much more powerful and user-friendly. That's why I'm proud to include this project in my ePortfolio as a reflection of my skills, 
          my growth, and my ability to deliver professional-quality work.

      <!-- ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES SECTION -->

      <section id="category2" class="section">
        <h2>Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>


      <p>
        The artifact I selected for this milestone is a full-stack web application originally developed as a console-based 
        Java Program for managing rescue animals. The original program used arrays and procedural logic to handle user input 
        and manage animal data entirely in memory using ArrayLists. Each operation required manual iteration through lists 
        using basic for-loops, which resulted in O(n) time complexity for searching and filtering operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        To align with the Algorithms and Data Structures category, I enhanced the application by adding dynamic filtering, 
        sorting, and efficient querying capabilities. The updated version stores animal records in MongoDB, uses Spring Boot 
        for the backend, and Angular for the frontend. Filtering logic was redesigned to use database queries instead of in-memory 
        loops, allowing multiple filters such as animal type, size, age range, and availability, along with sorting options.
      </p>

      <h3>Filtering Enhancements</h3>

      <p>
        Originally, searching for animals involved scanning each item in the list manually, which becomes inefficient for large datasets. 
        In the enhanced version, this is replaced by MongoDB queries using indexed fields, significantly improving query time to O(log n) 
        or even O(1) for simple lookups. The filtering system was implemented using checkboxes and numerical inputs that dynamically 
        update query parameters sent to the backend. The backend constructs MongoDB queries based on active filters, validating parameters 
        before building the query to avoid conflicting filters.
      </p>

      <h3>Original Linear Search Example:</h3>

      <pre><code>
        for (Dog dog : dogList) {
          if (dog.getTrainingStatus().equalsIgnoreCase("in service") && !dog.getReserved()) {
            availableList.add(dog);
          }
        }
      </code></pre>


      <h3>Enhanced MongoDB Filtering:</h3>

      <div class="filter-code-stack">
        <img src="images/enhanced-query1.png" alt="Filter1 Code">
        <img src="images/enhanced-query2.png " alt="Filter2 Code">
      </div>

      <h3>Sorting Enhancements</h3>

      <p>
        Originally, animals were displayed in the order they were added, with no sorting options. In the enhanced version, sorting is implemented 
        using Spring Data's Sort object. Users select sorting options from a dropdown, which are passed to the backend where sorting is applied 
        directly in the MongoDB query.
      </p>

      <img src="images/enhanced-sorting-code.png " alt="Sort Code" class="sorting-code-screenshot">

      

      <h3>Pagination and Reset</h3>

      <p>
        Pagination was added to keep the frontend responsive by limiting results displayed per page. A reset button allows users to clear all filters 
        and start fresh.
      </p>


      <h3>Enhancement Pagination Backend Code:</h3>

      <img src="images/pagination1.png" alt="Pagination Code" class="pagination-code-screenshot">

      <h3>Real-World Problem Solving</h3>

      <p>
        During development, I encountered issues with overlapping filter conditions when multiple filters were active at the same time. The backend 
        received conflicting query parameters, resulting in unpredictable results. I solved this by restructuring the query building logic to validate 
        each parameter individually before applying it to the MongoDB query. This greatly improved both the stability and scalability of the filtering system.
      </p>

      <h3>UI with Enhancements</h3>

      <div class="filtering-image-stack">
        <img src="images/rescue-animals.png" alt="Rescue Animals Page">
        <img src="images/rescue-animals-filter.png" alt="Filtering Rescue Animals">
        <img src="images/rescue-animals-sorted.png" alt="Sorting Rescue Animals">
      </div>

      <h3>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>

      <p>
        This enhancement supports course outcome 3 by applying algorithmic thinking to improve data filtering, sorting, and searching. It also supports course 
        outcome 4 by applying professional tools like MongoDB, Spring Boot, and Angular to create a modern, efficient, and scalable system.

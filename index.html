        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and goal-oriented software engineer with a diverse background in application development. 
          My experience spans mobile and web technologies, including developing and publishing Android applications using 
          Java and Android Studio, and building scalable full-stack web applications. I've worked with both the 
          <strong>MERN</strong> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and <strong>MEAN</strong> (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stacks, 
          gaining hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, managing asynchronous data flow, and developing dynamic front-end interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I've worked with a range of technologies, I chose to focus this capstone project on the MEAN stack — specifically using 
          Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB — to demonstrate a solid understanding of scalable, component-based design and secure 
          backend development. The project is a transformation of a Java-based command-line rescue animal management system into a 
          fully-featured web application. It reflects my ability to apply modern software design principles, implement secure authentication, 
          and structure a project using modular architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ePortfolio highlights enhancements made in three core categories: 
          <strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong>, 
          <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>, and 
          <strong>Databases</strong>. These enhancements showcase not only my technical growth throughout the Computer Science program, 
          but also my ability to learn new technologies, solve real-world problems, and build solutions that are efficient, maintainable, 
          and user-focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          I encourage you to begin with a <a href="#code-review" data-section="code-review">Code Review</a> walkthrough of the original application, where I explain the evolution from a command-line Java program to a full-stack web application. 
          If you're more interested in backend architecture and design principles, explore the <a href="#category1" data-section="category1">Software Engineering and Design</a> section, which highlights how I implemented secure APIs, followed design patterns, and refactored the codebase. 
          For insights into logic and performance, head over to the <a href="#category2" data-section="category2">Algorithms and Data Structures</a> section, where I demonstrate filtering, sorting, and optimization techniques. 
          Finally, the <a href="#category3" data-section="category3">Databases</a> section focuses on my use of MongoDB for dynamic schema design and efficient querying. 
          Each section offers a focused lens on a different technical area, allowing you to explore the skills and enhancements.

      <!-- CODE REVIEW SECTION -->
      <section id="code-review" class="section">
        <h2>Code Review</h2>
  
        <p>
          A code review is a systematic process in which developers examine each other's code to identify bugs,
          improve code quality, and ensure that the codebase meets industry standards. It promotes collaboration,
          encourages learning, and helps catch issues early before they become costly problems in production.
          Code reviews are an essential part of professional software development workflows, used in both open-source
          and enterprise teams.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The benefits of a code review include improved readability, better maintainability, consistency in coding style,
          and increased overall reliability of software. It also serves as an opportunity for knowledge sharing and mentoring,
          making teams more resilient and aligned in their practices.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In the video below, I walk through the original version of my Rescue Animal Management System, a Java-based console program.
          I then explain the structured enhancements I implemented as part of my CS 499 Capstone Project. These enhancements showcase 
          my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and full-stack web development using Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.
          I highlight specific code improvements, architectural decisions, and technical challenges I solved during the transformation
          of the system into a web application.

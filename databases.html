        <h2>Category 3: Databases</h2>

        <p>
          The artifact I selected for this milestone is the same Rescue Animal Management System that I enhanced for Categories 1 and 2. 
          It originally began as a Java-based console application developed in my IT-145 course. In that version, all animal records were stored 
          temporarily in memory using ArrayLists. This meant that any time the program was closed, all data was lost. There was no true database or 
          data persistence in place. Just temporary data structures used during runtime. While this allowed basic intake and reservation of rescue dogs 
          and monkeys, it was not suitable for real-world use where data integrity and long-term storage are required.
        </p>

        <p>
          To align with the Databases category, I enhanced the program by implementing a proper data persistence layer using MongoDB, a document-oriented 
          NoSQL database. I used Spring Data MongoDB to map Java objects directly to MongoDB documents. I also redesigned the backend model structure by 
          creating a unified Animal model that allows both dogs and monkeys to be stored together in a single collection. This made the system more flexible 
          and scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Repository interface provides an abstraction layer that allows my application to communicate with MongoDB using standard method definitions,
          eliminating the need to write raw queries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, instead of losing data when the program stops, all animal information is permanently stored in the database and can be retrieved, updated, 
          or queried across sessions and devices. The backend communicates directly with MongoDB to perform full CRUD operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and integrate a real-world database into a full-stack 
          system. It shows my understanding of data modeling, how to map Java objects to MongoDB documents, and how to handle important database concerns like 
          validation, structure, and security.
        </p>

        <p>
          During development, I encountered several challenges that I successfully solved. One issue involved how MongoDB handles ObjectId values. Originally, 
          mismatches between ObjectId and String types created issues when retrieving or updating records. I resolved this by standardizing IDs as String throughout 
          the entire full-stack system, ensuring consistency between the frontend (Angular) and backend (Spring Boot).
        </p>

        <p>
          Another challenge was handling validation properly before storing records in MongoDB. Because MongoDB is schema-less, I used Spring Boot validation 
          annotations such as @NotBlank, @Size, and others to ensure all incoming data was valid before being inserted into the database. I also implemented proper 
          exception handling to display useful error messages when invalid data was submitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>

        <p>
          This enhancement directly supports Course Outcome 3 by demonstrating my ability to evaluate storage solutions and implement scalable databases. 
          It supports Course Outcome 4 by applying innovative modern tools like MongoDB, Spring Boot, and Spring Data. It also demonstrates Course Outcome 5 by 
          focusing on secure data storage, validation, and integrity protection.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Overall, this enhancement transformed my application from a short-lived, memory-based program into a durable, full-stack, data-driven system that is 
          scalable, reliable, and secure. It demonstrates my ability to build persistent systems that handle real-world data challenges and to design robust solutions 
          using modern full-stack technologies.

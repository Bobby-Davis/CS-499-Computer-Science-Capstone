        <h2>Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>


      <p>
        The artifact I selected for this milestone is a full-stack web application originally developed as a console-based 
        Java Program for managing rescue animals. The original program used arrays and procedural logic to handle user input 
        and manage animal data entirely in memory using ArrayLists. Each operation required manual iteration through lists 
        using basic for-loops, which resulted in O(n) time complexity for searching and filtering operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        To align with the Algorithms and Data Structures category, I enhanced the application by adding dynamic filtering, 
        sorting, and efficient querying capabilities. The updated version stores animal records in MongoDB, uses Spring Boot 
        for the backend, and Angular for the frontend. Filtering logic was redesigned to use database queries instead of in-memory 
        loops, allowing multiple filters such as animal type, size, age range, and availability, along with sorting options.
      </p>

      <h3>Filtering Enhancements</h3>

      <p>
        Originally, searching for animals involved scanning each item in the list manually, which becomes inefficient for large datasets. 
        In the enhanced version, this is replaced by MongoDB queries using indexed fields, significantly improving query time to O(log n) 
        or even O(1) for simple lookups. The filtering system was implemented using checkboxes and numerical inputs that dynamically 
        update query parameters sent to the backend. The backend constructs MongoDB queries based on active filters, validating parameters 
        before building the query to avoid conflicting filters.
      </p>

      <h5 class="image-text">Original Linear Search Example:</h5>

      <pre><code>
        for (Dog dog : dogList) {
          if (dog.getTrainingStatus().equalsIgnoreCase("in service") && !dog.getReserved()) {
            availableList.add(dog);
          }
        }
      </code></pre>

      </div>

      <h3>Sorting Enhancements</h3>

      <p>
        Originally, animals were displayed in the order they were added, with no sorting options. In the enhanced version, sorting is implemented 
        using Spring Data's Sort object. Users select sorting options from a dropdown, which are passed to the backend where sorting is applied 
        directly in the MongoDB query.
      </p>

      <h3>Pagination and Reset</h3>

      <p>
        Pagination was added to keep the frontend responsive by limiting results displayed per page. A reset button allows users to clear all filters 
        and start fresh.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

      <p>
        During development, I encountered issues with overlapping filter conditions when multiple filters were active at the same time. The backend 
        received conflicting query parameters, resulting in unpredictable results. I solved this by restructuring the query building logic to validate 
        each parameter individually before applying it to the MongoDB query. This greatly improved both the stability and scalability of the filtering system.

      <h3>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>

      <p>
        This enhancement supports course outcome 3 by applying algorithmic thinking to improve data filtering, sorting, and searching. It also supports course 
        outcome 4 by applying professional tools like MongoDB, Spring Boot, and Angular to create a modern, efficient, and scalable system.
